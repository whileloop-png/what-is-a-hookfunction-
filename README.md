What is "hookfunction" in Roblox?
in roblox, hookfunction is used to intercept, replace, or extend the behavior of existing functions or methods in a script. It allows you to modify the behavior of a function at runtime, meaning you can change how a function works while the game is running.

In simple terms, hookfunction is a way to replace a function with your own. You can still use the original function, but you now have the ability to alter its behavior, log information, or even block the function from executing altogether.

Basic Explanation of "hookfunction":
When you use hookfunction, you're basically telling the script to replace the original function with your own custom version. This can be useful for things like:

Modifying function behavior (e.g., adding extra logging, modifying the inputs or outputs).
Preventing a function from running (e.g., blocking a specific behavior in a game).
Creating custom interactions (e.g., adding new features to existing functions).
How Does It Work?
You create a hook function that takes the same parameters as the original function.
Your hook function can modify the behavior or return values of the function.
The hook function is applied to the original function, so the original function is "replaced" by the hook function.




Why Use "hookfunction"?

Debugging: you can hook functions to track what data is being passed. For example, logging function calls and their parameters can provide insight into whatâ€™s happening and how it's happening (which helps wink wink).

Preventing Specific Actions: if you want to block certain actions (shitty anticheats, or even replacing raycasting with your own! WINK WINK), you can hook the relevant functions and prevent them from running.

etc etc, im too lazy for this
